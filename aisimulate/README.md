# AI Simulate

> [!WARNING]
> **Experimental.** AI Simulate and Spica are intended for evaluation and feedback, not production
> capacity planning. Their APIs, configuration schemas, search behavior, and output may change
> without a standard deprecation period. They provide no SLA, accuracy, or configuration-optimality

AI Simulate is a standalone Python distribution in the Dynamo repository. Its first package,
`aisimulate.spica`, searches backend deployment settings by evaluating serializable replay
specifications. The package does not depend on `ai-dynamo`.

Spica accepts a replay `RunnerFactory` through its Python API. Optional feature adapters own
their search spaces and runtime hooks. A backend-only sweep can use a Dynamo-free replay runner;
a sweep configured with Dynamo Planner or Router adapters uses Dynamo's runner composition.

Install AI Simulate by itself for backend-only development:

```bash
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ./aisimulate
```

For Dynamo features, install the matching `ai-dynamo[simulate]` extra. It installs the Planner
simulation dependencies and publishes the `dynamo.planner` and `dynamo.router` adapter entry
points plus a Dynamo runner that composes those adapters with the shared AI Simulate Replayer.

Run a sweep from Python with an explicit runner:

```python
from aisimulate.spica import SmartSearchConfig, run_smart_search
from dynamo.replay.simulation import DynamoReplayRunnerFactory

config = SmartSearchConfig.from_yaml("smart_sweep.yaml")
candidates = run_smart_search(
    config,
    runner_factory=DynamoReplayRunnerFactory(),
)
```

The standalone module validates the backend-neutral core schema but intentionally has no implicit
replay runtime. Adapter-owned search spaces are validated when the selected adapters are resolved
by `run_smart_search`.
KVBM sweep fields have been removed and have no adapter migration.

Read the [Spica documentation](../docs/fern/pages/developer-guide/knowledge-base/modular-components/ai-simulate-experimental/spica-experimental/overview.md)
for its configuration, search-space, and replay behavior. Runnable configurations and tools live
under [`examples/aisimulate/spica`](../examples/aisimulate/spica/README.md).
